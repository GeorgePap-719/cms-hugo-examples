# Notes

- todo: we have to spec down the requirements.
- does not feel good choice time-wise.

Combinations with gohugo static generator.

## cloudcannon

Seems like a very minimal choice but with heavy configuration, hence heavy-time-wise sink. 
Feels like way too much commitment at this point. 

- Has a visual-editor.
- Integrates nice with hugo and github.

## decapcms

Minimal choice but requires something like netlify for full integration.
Similar choice as above overall.
