# Notes

Combinations with gohugo static generator.

## cloudcannon

Seems like a very minimal choice but with heavy configuration, hence heavy-time-wise investment.

- Has a visual-editor.
- Integrates nice with hugo and github.
- General ticks all the requirements.

## decapcms

Minimal choice but requires something like netlify for full integration.
Similar choice as above overall.

## StoryBlok

- No "ready" integration with hugo. But has integration with gatsby if we really want to give it a
  try.
